                        <br>At St. Alphonsus Primary School we believe in the value of every child and adult who enters our doors and becomes part of our community and by showing value, we expect them to show value and respect towards one another. We encourage and support every child to reach their true potential, leaving them equipped and empowered for the next step of their life as Rights Respecting global citizens.<br>
                        <br>We are situated in the heart of an urban regeneration area in a superb primary school building, which opened in September 2004. The building was extended in 2015, enabling us to move to two form entry and creating a wonderful open plan early years resource.  We have extensive  grounds, including an internal courtyard in which we we have created a sensory garden and also a wild woods area for forestieres to explore and adventure. We put a great deal of emphasis on learning outside of the classroom. Within the school grounds we have created an outdoor classroom, KS1 and KS2 activity areas and further play areas in early years, including a mud kitchen, woodland walk and castle tree house as well as a wildlife and woodland area.</p>
